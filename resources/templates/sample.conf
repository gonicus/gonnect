## ”10.0.0.1:3478” (IP address and port number)
## When nameserver is configured in the pjsua_config.nameserver field, if entry is not an IP address,
## it will be resolved with DNS SRV resolution first, and it will fallback to use DNS A resolution if this fails.
## Port number may be specified even if the entry is a domain name, in case the DNS SRV resolution should fallback to a non-standard port.
## When nameserver is not configured, entries will be resolved with pj_gethostbyname() if it’s not an IP address.
## Port number may be specified if the server is not listening in standard STUN port.

## Optional private key of the endpoint certificate to be used.
## default: ""
#privateKeyFile=/home/user/.cert/default-combined.pem

## Specifies TLS transport behavior on the server TLS certificate verification result:
## If verifyServer is disabled, TLS transport will just notify the application via pjsip_tp_state_callback with state PJSIP_TP_STATE_CONNECTED regardless TLS verification result.
## If verifyServer is enabled, TLS transport will be shutdown and application will be notified with state PJSIP_TP_STATE_DISCONNECTED whenever there is any TLS verification error, otherwise PJSIP_TP_STATE_CONNECTED will be notified.
## In any cases, application can inspect pjsip_tls_state_info in the callback to see the verification detail.
## default: false
#verifyServer=false

## This option is used to update the transport address and the Contact header of REGISTER request.
## When this option is enabled, the library will keep track of the public IP address from the response of REGISTER request.
## Once it detects that the address has changed, it will unregister current Contact, update the Contact with transport address learned from Via header,
## and register a new Contact to the registrar. This will also update the public name of UDP transport if STUN is configured.
## Possible values:
## 0 (disabled).
## 1 (enabled). Update except if both Contact and server’s IP address are public but response contains private IP.
## 2 (enabled). Update without exception.
## See also contactRewriteMethod field.
## default: 0
#contactRewriteUse=0

## Specify how Contact update will be done with the registration, if contactRewriteEnabled is enabled.
## The value is bitmask combination of pjsua_contact_rewrite_method. See also pjsua_contact_rewrite_method.
## Possbiel values:
## "always-update"
## "no-unreg"
## default: always-update
## This field is mandatory.
#contactRewriteMethod=always-update # always-update / no-unreg

## Specify if source TCP port should be used as the initial Contact address if TCP/TLS transport is used.
## Note that this feature will be automatically turned off when nameserver is configured because it may yield different destination address due to DNS SRV resolution.
## Also some platforms are unable to report the local address of the TCP socket when it is still connecting. In these cases, this feature will also be turned off.
## default: true
#contactUseSrcPort=true

## Control the use of STUN for the SIP signaling.
## default: true
#sipStunUse=false

## Control the use of STUN for the media transports.
## default: false

## default: true
#iceAggressiveNomination=true

## Disable RTCP component.
## default: false
#iceNoRtcp=false

## Always send re-INVITE/UPDATE after ICE negotiation regardless of whether the default ICE transport address is changed or not.
## When this is set to False, re-INVITE/UPDATE will be sent only when the default ICE transport address is changed.
## default: true
#iceAlwaysUpdate=true

## This option is used to overwrite the “sent-by” field of the Via header for outgoing messages with the same interface address as the one in the REGISTER request,
## as long as the request uses the same transport instance as the previous REGISTER request. 
## default: true
#viaRewriteUse=true

## This option controls whether the IP address in SDP should be replaced with the IP address found in Via header of the REGISTER response, ONLY when STUN and ICE are not used.
## If the value is FALSE (the original behavior), then the local IP address will be used. If TRUE, and when STUN and ICE are disabled,
## then the IP address found in registration response will be used.
## default: false
#sdpNatRewriteUse=false

## Control the use of SIP outbound feature. SIP outbound is described in RFC 5626 to enable proxies or registrar to send inbound requests back to UA
## using the same connection initiated by the UA for its registration. This feature is highly useful in NAT-ed deployemtns, hence it is enabled by default.
## Note: currently SIP outbound can only be used with TCP and TLS transports.
## If UDP is used for the registration, the SIP outbound feature will be silently ignored for the account.
## default: true
#sipOutboundUse=true

## Specify SIP outbound (RFC 5626) instance ID to be used by this account. If empty, an instance ID will be generated based on the hostname of this agent.
## If application specifies this parameter, the value will look like “<urn:uuid:00000000-0000-1000-8000-AABBCCDDEEFF>” without the double-quotes.
## default: ""
#sipOutboundInstanceId=

## Specify SIP outbound (RFC 5626) registration ID. The default value is empty, which would cause the library to automatically generate a suitable value.
## default: ""
#sipOutboundRegId=

## Points to the name of the desired auth section in the configuration - if any.
#auth=auth0

## Configures the SIP transport.
## Possible values: "tcp", "udp", "tls"
## default: "tls"
#transport=tls

## Configures the IP version type that should be used.
## The value "auto" lets the application try to determine the best one by itself. Setting a specific IP version enforces it.
## Possible values: "auto", "ipv4", "ipv6"
## default: "auto"
#network=auto

## When a call to another SIP client is established, _GOnnect_ automatically tries to negotiate capabilities per instant messaging with its counterpart, like the possibility
## to upgrade the call to a Jitsi Meet session. However, some pbx setups disallow SIP messaging and on complex setups, it might be impossible for _GOnnect_ to check reliably
## whether it is allowed or not. This flag can be used to disable the capability negotiation completely.
## default: true
#negotiateCapabilities=true


#[auth0]
## The authentication scheme (e.g. “digest”).

## Preferred identities can be used to change how the client will be received at the callee.
## For example, when calling a specific customer (with a given prefix), the callee receives not the actual phone number of the
## caller, but another one, e.g. from a support hotline.
## Which identity should be used as default, resp. how it should be determined is set via the option "preferredIdentity" in the general section of this file (see above).
## These identities can be via the UI or here (e.g. for provisioning).
## Example (all fields are mandatory unless specified as optional):

## Each identity is a section, starting with "preferred_identity_" and followed by one or more digits.
#[preferred_identity_0]

## Whether the identity is enabled. If it is not, it cannot be selected neither manually nor automatically.
#enabled=true

## Whether the identity is respected when the option "preferredIdentity" is set to "auto", i.e. if set to false, this identity can only be selected manually.
#automatic=true

## A display name that is shown in the UI
#name=Send number

## The phone number, that the callee shall receive when using this identity.
#identity=+4929339114711

## The prefix to test against when this identity is considered for the "auto" mode of the option "preferredIdentity".
## When the called phone number (on outgoing calls) starts with this prefix, this identity will be chosen automatically.
## Multiple prefixes can be set when comma-separated.
## This is only used when "automatic" is set to true.
## (optional)
#prefix=+492913641,+49123


## This section defines how different dial tones are produced by the ring tone generator.
## There is rarely a need to change them, but it is possible in order to suit regional practices.
##
## The format follows this structure:
## frequency1, frequency2, [ interval1, interval2 ]+, loopIndex
##
## frequency1 and frequency2 defines two frequencies in Hz, with 0 meaning "off".  
## Then, one or more tuples of intervals (in ms) follow, each describing how long frequency1 (first value) and frequency2 (second value) shall be played.
## Finally, the last value (loopIndex) indicates from which tuple index it shall loop. A loopIndex of "0" means that nothing is repeated.
##
## Example: 
## 425,0,200,200,200,1000,200,200,200,1000,200,200,200,5000,4
## 
## will play the frequency 425 Hz followed by a pause (0 Hz) with these intervals:
##
## +---+-----------------+-----------------+
## | i | frequency1 [ms] | freuqency2 [ms] |
## +---+-----------------+-----------------+
## | 0 |             200 |             200 |
## | 1 |             200 |            1000 |
## | 2 |             200 |             200 |
## | 3 |             200 |            1000 |
## | 4 |             200 |             200 |
## | 5 |             200 |            5000 |
## +---+-----------------+-----------------+
##
## When finished, it will infinitely play lines 4 and 5 again (loopIndex = 4).
##
##
## default:
#[dialtones]
#ring="425,0,1000,4000,0"
#busy="425,0,480,480,0"
#congestion="425,0,240,240,0"
#zip="425,0,200,200,200,1000,200,200,200,1000,200,200,200,5000,4"


## An LDAP block defines one LDAP source for the address book.
## Example (all fields are mandatory unless specified as optional):

## Each block must have the name "ldap", followed by one ore more digits.
#[ldap0]

## The URL of the LDAP service
#url="ldap://ldap.intranet.example.org"

## The LDAP base for the search
#base="dc=example,dc=org"

## The LDAP filter for the search
#filter="(&(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)(!(loginShell=/bin/false)))"

## The method used for LDAP bind
## The possible values are:
## "none": Do not use any LDAP bind. This is useful if the authentication is handled by the os config.
## "simple": LDAP simple bind. In this case a dn must be set. The password will be requested via a GUI dialog and stored encrypted.
## "gssapi": LDAP SASL bind per GSSAPI. Which other options (see below) must be set depends on the server configuration.
##
## default: "none"
## (optional)
#bindMethod="none"

## Whether to use SSL/TLS for the LDAP bind
## (optional, default: false)
# useSSL=false

## The dn used for LDAP simple bind
## This is the dn used for LDAP bind when the property "bindMethod" is set to "simple". It is ignored when "bindMethod" is "none" or not set. 
## When using with a SASL bind mechanism, the bindDn will be used, but the LDAP server will most likely ignore it.
## (required | ignored)
#bindDn="cn=manager, o=university of michigan, c=us"

## A phone number prefix which is stripped from each phone number read from the LDAP source.
## This is useful to strip a company's own number and just take the "internal number".
## Example: Given baseNumber="+492933911", the number "+492933911678" will appear as "678" in the address book.
## (optional)
#baseNumber="+492933911"

## If the SIP environment the client is used in does support subscribing to buddy states (i.e. if a contact is available, busy, etc.), the phone number
## found for this LDAP attribute will be used for that subscription.
## This is a performance optimization: when numbers saved under a specific attribute can and will never be subscriptable for SIP states (e.g. "mobile"), 
## the client does not need to try. While not an excessive overhead, it might affect performance on slow systems and a large number of subscriptions.
## Multiple values must be comma-seperated, e.g. "telephoneNumber,mobile"
## (optional)
#sipStatusSubscriptableAttributes="telephoneNumber"

## Realm as it might be required for SASL LDAP bind
## default: ""
## (optional)
#realm="myldap.org"

## Authcid as it might be required for SASL LDAP bind
## default: ""
## (optional)
#authcid="foo@myldap.org"

## Authzid as it might be required for SASL LDAP bind
## default: ""
## (optional)
#authzid="bar@myldap.org"


## A CardDAV block defines a CardDAV source for the address book.
## The password for the authentication will be requested in a UI dialog on next start of the app. It will then be saved encrypted for further usage in
## the config file named "keychain". Delete the appropriate part there to enforce a new password request.
## The contacts will be loaded asynchronously on app start. Depending on quantity and server speed, it might take a few minutes until all contacts
## are loaded.
## Example (all fields are mandatory unless specified as optional):

## Each block (= CardDAV source) must have the name "carddav", followed by one or more digits.
# [carddav0]

## The host is the main host address of the remote server, without any port, protocol or path data.
# host=cloud.mycompany.com

## The path relative to the host were to find the resource.
# path=/remote.php/dav/addressbooks/users/john/contacts/

## The user name required for the authentication.
# user=john

## The server port.
## (optional, defaults: 443 is used if useSSL is true, 80 if false)
# port=443

## Whether to use SSL (https) or not (http).
## (optional, default: false)
# useSSL=false

## Path to a CA certificate to use when useSSL is enabled.
## (optional)
# caFile=/home/user123/.cert/my_ca.crt

# # Whether a button to upgrade to a Jitsi Meet session should be displayed, if the counterpart is also a GOnnect client.
# [jitsi]
# # The base URL to initiate Jitsi Meet session on
# url=https://meet.example.com

# # The name to display in the Jitsi Meet session
# displayName=""

# # Whether to show the Jitsi pre-join screen
# preconfig=false
